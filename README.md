# minecraft-server-status-checker
Checks minecraft server status and execute that code that you want (there some premaded code like notification or print).
May used to getting notification when your liked server was come online or offline, or for parsing data, and getting notification when there was overload on the server.
There was no limits to what you can do with that, this project just gives some basic interface for getting data, and just gives your raw data for parsing.
